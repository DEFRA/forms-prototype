"Placement / discoverability: Page conditions and repeater questions only appeared on a separate page after saving a
question, causing uncertainty. Participants expected page heading, guidance, and conditions to appear earlier in the
flow. Some felt conditions were 'hidden' and wanted them more prominent.",
"Existing vs new condition: Participants often clicked 'Add an existing condition' first (because it appeared
first), before realising they should create a new one.",
"Setup experience: Mixed - some found it simple and intuitive; others struggled. Not obvious that conditions only
work if questions are on separate pages. Some put two questions on one page and hit issues.",
"Terminology: The word 'operator' confused people; they preferred familiar terms like 'condition' or 'options'. One
participant said setting a condition felt like 'working backwards' (starting from the answer instead of the question).",
"Preview & checking conditions: Some had trouble finding or using preview to check conditions. Participants missed
the 'filter by conditions' dropdown - it didn't mean much to them. They wanted a flow chart view of the routing, but
instead clicked through the prototype to test conditions."

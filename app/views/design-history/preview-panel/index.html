The preview panel allows users to see what their form will look like to members of the public
while building it. It updates in real time and supports list-based question types such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and
repeatable question sets. You can <a href='/design-system/editor/preview-panel'

Validate DXT labels and content used through the new design\n- Identify what works well and what does not work well\n-
Identify any missing functionality/information\n- Identify any additional user needs and expectations\n- Validate the

land/buildings used for livestock.\n\n**Tasks included:**\n- Create a new form\n- Ask a single question to be answered
once (e.g. when did you buy your cattle?)\n- Ask more than one question per page, to be answered more than once
(repeater, e.g. for each cow: breed, date left, date arrived)\n\n**Key finding:** The repeater concept was not clear to

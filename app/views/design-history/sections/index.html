<div class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What the feature does</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">This feature lets form builders group pages into sections. Sections act as headings that sit
        above related pages or questions. When users fill in the form, these headings appear in the right places so the
        form is easier to follow. They also show on the Check your answers page, helping people quickly see which
        answers belong together.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why it matters</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">In the previous iteration of the form builder, there was a way to add sub-headings directly
        above page titles. This gave some structure, but the latest version of the tool didn't carry that functionality
        forward. During testing, users said this made Check your answers pages harder to read, because all the answers
        ran together without clear grouping.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The new sections feature fixes that by re-introducing headings — but in a more structured way.
        Instead of adding headings one by one to pages, you can now create reusable sections and assign pages to them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><strong>Create sections:</strong> Give them a name, which becomes a heading. Sections are numbered
            automatically and shown in the order you create them.</li>
        <li><strong>Assign pages:</strong> Move pages from an "Ungrouped" list into a section. You can ungroup them
            later if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Hide or remove:</strong> You can hide a section so it doesn't show up in the live form, or remove it
            entirely. Removing a section with pages just moves those pages back into the ungrouped list.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> You can't create a section without a name, or reuse an existing section name.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it displays in the runner</h2>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><strong>Guidance pages:</strong> Section heading (H2) appears above the page heading.</li>
        <li><strong>Check your answers page:</strong> Section heading (H2) appears above the grouped questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Question pages:</strong>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>If the page has its own heading → section heading sits above it.</li>
                <li>If the page is a repeating group → section heading is hidden.</li>
                <li>If no page heading is set → section heading appears at the top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hide option:</strong> If you tick "hide section," the heading won't appear in the runner at all.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research findings</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Round 13 - April 2025</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Most participants managed to complete the process of creating sections and pages, however:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Some participants found the distinction between "page" and "section" unclear, and described the experience
            as "confusing"</li>
        <li>One participant speculated that visual layout of the tool may have contributed to her uncertainty. She felt
            that sections should appear above page header, because that would match how these elements are displayed on
            the page</li>
        <li>Some participants found it confusing that a section could appear above a page heading, which is firmly
            considered the H1 in their mental model</li>
        <li>One participant suggested adding H1/H2 labels to clarify the hierarchy</li>
        <li>Another participant raised concerns about potential SEO and accessibility issues related to repeated use of
            H1 and H2 headings</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Changes needed</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body">Clarify the distinction and hierarchy of page sections and page headings: some users found the
        distinction between "page" and "section" unclear and confusing. Consider changing the labels and/or the visual
        page layout, where sections appeared above page headings (which some users considered the h1). Consider adding
        h1/h2 labels to clarify the hierarchy between sections and pages.</p>
